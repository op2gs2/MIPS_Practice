# MIPS_Practice
- This is a repository for storing homework assignments from a MIPS Programming course (Computer Architecture Class)
- So, I just recommend my code for your reference code.
- (You are responsible for all your actions. Use of the code is considered a consent form.)
- I used a tool **MARS** which includes a MIPS Assembler and a Runtime Simulator. It needs a JAVA Running Enviorment (JRE or JDK).
- You can download the tool from [here](http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/mars/) and, you can practice my code.
